# Hoy hoy, world

In 2022 I founded Blue Engineering LLC. and have been working on the web since 2015. I've spent a majority of my time working in the non-profit sector, but bring diverse experience from my time working in a local Marketing Agency (Wyoming Inc.), a non-profit school known as the National Outdoor Leadership School, the local hospital, and eventually went on to found my own consulting business (Blue Engineering LLC.).

Now you might find me at the local Lander Co-Working space (Lander Worx), the coffee shop in town, or lounging with my cat reading a good book. I am working for a wonderful company known as Language I/O (LIO) we focus on delivering an excellent multilingual customer service experience to Fortune 500 companies. As a Front-End Developer on the team my goal is to build and maintain features for the Zendesk integration. Our stack is a Java backend, with a React SPA as the frontend integration.
